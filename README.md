spgame
======
Repo for documenting client functions in a defunct MORPG Survival Project.

Introduction
-----
This repo is created by <a href="http://forum6.hkgolden.com/ProfilePage.aspx?userid=195369">HKG 巫毒兔子</a>, an hobbyist enthusiast in reverse engineering and maintained by our contributors' support. The project attempts to construct an SPGAME server by reversing the mechanisms in the game client.

<br />
This repo contains the products and work-in-process for <u>recovered functions</u> in the game client:<br />
<b>./asm</b>         for raw assembly<br />
<b>./src</b>         for recovered C++-style functions<br />
