spgame
======
This repo is created by HKG 巫毒兔子 and maintained by our contributors, an hobbyist enthusiast in reverse engineering. The project attempts to construct an SPGAME server by reversing the mechanisms in the game client.

This repo contains the products and work-in-process for recovered functions in the game client:
./asm         for raw assembly
./src         for recovered C++-style functions
