Hello world <img src="http://forum14.hkgolden.com/faces/xmas/bouncy.gif" /><img src="http://forum14.hkgolden.com/faces/xmas/bouncy.gif" /><br />

My name is usagi (巫毒兔子), which is "rabbit" in Japanese in case you are wondering.<br />
I am a member of the HKGolden forums, the hometown of awesome people <img src="http://forum14.hkgolden.com/faces/slick.gif" /><br />
Despite my major is not Computer Science (nor my minor), reverse engineering is my hobby :)<br />
<br />
Cadenza * is just my other pseudonym, although my name does start with a "C" and ends with an "a" <br />
<br />
I am looking forward to working with all 高登巴絲 ^ 3 ^
